- Valid client id (from Fortnox)
- Valid client secret (from Fortnox)
- Valid refresh token (from Fortnox)

## Fortnox authorization

In order to use the Fortnox API, you need a valid refresh token. 
To get a refresh token, you need to grant access to the integration via Fortnox's OAuth2 
authorization code flow. In that process, you are assigned an *authorization code*
that you can use to exchange for a pair of token:

The **access token** - which is used to authenticate all API request - is only valid 
for 1 hour and needs to be refreshed using a refresh token. This package handles 
that process as long you have a valid refresh token.

The **refresh token** - which is used to renew the access token - is valid for 30 days. 
If it expires, you need to redo the OAuth2 authorization flow.

Every time you renew you access token, you will be assigned a new refresh token that 
is valid for another 30 days. It is therefore important that you regularly renew 
the tokens so that the refresh token does not expire.

You can renew your tokens with the following command:

```
php artisan fortnox:refresh
```

*Both the access token and the refresh token are stored in your application's cache.
Keep this in mind when you purge the cache or changes cache driver.*
